                    <h2 id="SolutionApproach-TheParadigmShift:FromRecordstoInference">The Paradigm Shift: From Records to Inference</h2><p>The proposed evidence-based identity platform would represent a fundamental transformation in how government systems understand and process information about citizens. Rather than managing fixed records that attempt to capture definitive facts about people, the system would operate as a continuous inference engine that builds understanding through probabilistic reasoning over accumulated evidence.</p><p>This paradigm shift would acknowledge a crucial insight that traditional systems obscure: all government knowledge about citizens is inherently uncertain and provisional. When HMRC reports employment income, when a passport office issues identification, when a council confirms residence - these are assertions made by sources with varying degrees of verification rigor, not immutable facts about reality. The proposed evidence-based approach would make this uncertainty explicit and manageable rather than hiding it behind supposedly authoritative master records.</p><p>The inference engine would operate by treating all information as structured statements of &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; with comprehensive metadata about verification context, timing, and confidence levels. This would capture not just what was asserted, but who made the assertion, how they verified it before making the assertion, and how much confidence we should place in that verification process. Over time, as independent sources provide corroborating or contradictory evidence, the system's confidence in particular facts would increase or decrease accordingly.</p><p>Citizens and caseworkers would never interact directly with this probabilistic complexity. They would continue to experience familiar binary outcomes - applications approved or denied, awards calculated or suspended, investigations opened or closed. The managed complexity approach would ensure that sophisticated uncertainty reasoning operates behind simple, understandable interfaces that preserve the definitiveness citizens expect from government services.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-ManagedComplexityArchitecture">Managed Complexity Architecture</h2><p>The managed complexity principle would resolve the apparent contradiction between acknowledging uncertainty and providing definitive government services. The system would maintain two distinct operational layers that serve different purposes while working together seamlessly.</p><p>The user interface layer would preserve the illusion of definitive decisions that citizens and caseworkers require for effective interaction with government services. Citizens would see binary award decisions with clear amounts and effective dates. Caseworkers would work with familiar investigation workflows that provide clear action items and decision points. Awards would appear stable unless exceptional circumstances trigger changes, and all complexity would remain hidden behind simple, understandable interfaces.</p><p>Beneath this interface layer, the backend would operate as a sophisticated probabilistic reasoning system that assesses real-world identity as low, medium, or high trust levels based on accumulated evidence. The system would only make benefit awards when both identity confidence and attribute confidence meet high thresholds appropriate for the financial stakes involved. When confidence levels drop due to contradictory evidence or when new information creates uncertainty, the system would trigger investigation workflows rather than making automatic adjustments that could disadvantage citizens.</p><p>This architecture would provide several operational advantages. Citizens would receive consistent, understandable service while the system becomes increasingly intelligent about risk assessment and fraud prevention. Caseworkers would focus their attention on genuine exceptions that require human judgment rather than routine verification tasks. Most importantly, the system could evolve and improve its reasoning capabilities without requiring citizens or caseworkers to adapt to new interfaces or procedures.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-Evidence-FirstInformationArchitecture">Evidence-First Information Architecture</h2><p>The technical foundation of the proposed evidence-based approach would treat raw evidence as the primary asset, with all derived attributes and policy-specific interpretations calculated from this evidence base rather than stored as separate facts. This would invert the traditional approach where systems store policy-specific attributes and lose the underlying evidence context that would enable sharing across different policy domains.</p><p>When evidence arrives through any channel - scanned documents, API feeds from external systems, agent-facilitated phone calls, or self-service online forms - the system would extract structured assertions with full provenance metadata. A driving license would become &quot;DVLA asserted on [date] that person with photo [cryptographic hash] passed driving test and has address X, verified through [specific process].&quot; A payslip would become &quot;Employer Y asserted that person Z earned amount W in period V, verified through [employment verification process].&quot;</p><p>This evidence-first approach would enable powerful capabilities that traditional document-centric systems cannot provide. The system could automatically cross-correlate income assertions from employers with bank deposit assertions to detect inconsistencies. Address assertions from multiple sources could be compared for consistency and confidence scoring. Evidence verified through different methods would receive appropriate confidence weights that inform subsequent decision-making. Multiple independent assertions about the same attribute would increase overall confidence through systematic corroboration analysis.</p><p>The evidence would accumulate with full audit trails that preserve not just what was asserted, but the complete verification context that enables appeals, investigations, and quality improvement. When citizens challenge decisions, the system could provide comprehensive explanations of exactly which evidence supported the outcome and how confidence levels were calculated. This transparency would support both accountability requirements and continuous improvement of verification processes.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-SemanticTranslationforPolicyAutonomy">Semantic Translation for Policy Autonomy</h2><p>One of the most sophisticated aspects of the proposed evidence-based approach would be its handling of legitimate policy differences across DCS services. Rather than forcing artificial standardization that would break either legal requirements or operational effectiveness, the system would enable different policies to interpret the same evidence appropriately for their specific purposes through automated semantic translation.</p><p>The semantic translation layer would use formal ontologies to capture how different DCS services define concepts and verification standards. BasicSupport's definition of &quot;monthly income&quot; would serve employment-focused eligibility calculations that require recent employment verification. AgeCare's &quot;weekly pension income&quot; would serve age-related benefit calculations that prioritize pension provider verification. These differences would reflect genuine policy requirements that should be preserved rather than artificially harmonized.</p><p>When evidence arrives that could serve multiple policy purposes, such as HMRC employment data indicating both BasicSupport eligibility and AgeCare work allowances, the semantic translation system would automatically convert the evidence into appropriate forms for each policy context. The original evidence verification context would be preserved, so confidence levels would appropriately reflect any uncertainty introduced by the translation process, and audit trails would maintain complete traceability from source evidence to policy-specific decisions.</p><p>This approach would enable evidence sharing while preserving policy autonomy. DCS services could continue operating according to their specific legal and business requirements while benefiting from evidence verification work done by other services. External partners could provide evidence once in their own vocabulary, with automatic translation handling the complexity of making that evidence useful across multiple DCS policy contexts.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-ProbabilisticIdentityResolution">Probabilistic Identity Resolution</h2><p>The identity resolution component would address the fundamental challenge that real-world identity is inherently uncertain and must be inferred from accumulated evidence rather than determined through authoritative lookup. Traditional systems assume that identity can be definitively established through documents or database matches, when in reality these approaches simply push the uncertainty problem to earlier verification stages without resolving it.</p><p>The proposed probabilistic approach would build identity clusters through machine learning algorithms that analyze patterns in attributes, relationships, and evidence sources to determine when different assertions likely refer to the same real-world person. These clusters would represent the system's current best understanding of distinct human entities based on available evidence, but they would be designed to evolve as new evidence arrives or as analysis improves.</p><p>Identity confidence would be calculated from multiple dimensions including evidence quality, verification diversity, temporal consistency, and relationship corroboration. A citizen with passport verification, recent bank statements, employer confirmation, and council tax records would achieve higher identity confidence than someone providing only self-declared information. However, confidence could increase over time as additional evidence accumulates, enabling citizens to access higher-value services as their evidence portfolio strengthens.</p><p>The probabilistic approach would gracefully handle complex scenarios that break traditional identity systems. When citizens use multiple Digital IDs for privacy separation, the system could recognize patterns suggesting common real-world identity while respecting their choice to keep different services separate. When evidence suggests that a single identity cluster incorrectly merged two different people, the system could split the cluster and redistribute evidence appropriately, triggering reassessment of any decisions that depended on the merged identity.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-Confidence-BasedAwardProcessing">Confidence-Based Award Processing</h2><p>The award calculation component would implement the crucial principle that government financial decisions should only be made when evidence quality justifies the risk involved. Rather than making awards based on incomplete or uncertain information, the system would apply confidence thresholds that ensure payments only occur when identity verification and circumstance assessment meet standards appropriate for the financial stakes.</p><p>High-value awards would require high confidence across multiple dimensions - identity verification, circumstance assessment, and evidence recency would all exceed thresholds calibrated to prevent fraud while enabling legitimate claims. Lower-value awards might proceed with moderate confidence levels, while emergency payments could be authorized with basic identity verification when humanitarian need outweighs fraud risk.</p><p>When confidence levels drop due to contradictory evidence, evidence aging, or identity uncertainty, the system would trigger investigation workflows rather than making automatic adjustments that could unfairly penalize citizens. This exception-based approach would ensure that human judgment applies to genuine edge cases while routine processing becomes increasingly automated as evidence accumulates and patterns become clear.</p><p>The confidence-based approach would provide natural fraud prevention that adapts to changing threat patterns without requiring constant rule updates. Fraudulent identities typically cannot accumulate the diverse, temporally consistent evidence that legitimate citizens develop through normal interaction with government and private sector services. The system would become more resistant to fraud over time as it learns to recognize authentic evidence patterns.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-Cross-SystemIntelligenceandPatternRecognition">Cross-System Intelligence and Pattern Recognition</h2><p>By accumulating evidence across all DCS services in a unified graph structure, the system would enable pattern recognition and intelligence sharing that is impossible when evidence remains isolated in separate systems. Fraud patterns that span multiple services would become visible through evidence correlation analysis. Citizens experiencing life changes that affect multiple benefit types could receive coordinated service that addresses their complete circumstances rather than fragmented responses from individual benefit areas.</p><p /><div class="ap-container" id="ap-com.stratusaddons.confluence.plugins.mermaid__mermaid-cloud6277298357921415833">

<p>The cross-system approach would support proactive service delivery where the system could identify citizens who might benefit from services they haven't yet discovered or applied for. A citizen receiving BasicSupport who experiences housing difficulties might benefit from housing support available through other DCS services, but current systems cannot identify these opportunities automatically. The proposed evidence-based approach would enable such connections while respecting citizen privacy and choice about service utilization.</p><p>Pattern recognition would also support continuous improvement of verification processes and fraud detection. When certain evidence sources consistently provide accurate information while others prove unreliable, the system could adjust confidence scoring accordingly. When fraud attempts use particular evidence patterns, the system could automatically increase scrutiny for similar patterns while maintaining fairness for legitimate citizens.</p><h2 id="SolutionApproach-IntegrationandEcosystemDevelopment">Integration and Ecosystem Development</h2><p>The proposed evidence-based approach would be designed to start within DCS's federation and expand to broader government services as value is proven and external partners are ready to participate. The technical architecture would support this expansion through standard interfaces and semantic translation capabilities that can accommodate different organizational vocabularies and verification standards.</p><p>External partners would benefit from simplified integration requirements where they can provide evidence once in their own format rather than adapting to multiple DCS-specific interfaces. Local authorities, housing providers, financial institutions, and other organizations could contribute verified evidence that immediately becomes useful across all relevant DCS services without requiring separate integration work for each service area.</p><p>The ecosystem approach would create positive network effects where each new participant makes the platform more valuable for existing participants while reducing their own integration costs. This would accelerate adoption and create sustainable incentives for continued participation and evidence quality improvement.</p><p>Success within DCS would provide concrete implementation experience that proves the approach's viability for broader government adoption. The same technologies and patterns that solve DCS's internal evidence sharing challenges could extend to cross-departmental evidence sharing when other government organizations are ready to participate. This would create a proven pathway for transforming government service delivery without requiring massive coordinated change across multiple departments simultaneously.</p><p />
