Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Evidence Ingestion Service</strong>: Provides trigger events for new evidence requiring identity correlation</p></li><li><p><strong>Semantic Translation Service</strong>: Supplies cross-context identity verification when correlating evidence from different policy domains</p></li></ul><p><strong>Downstream Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Award Calculation Service</strong>: Consumes identity confidence scores and cluster information for entitlement decisions</p></li><li><p><strong>Investigation Queue Service</strong>: Receives cases when identity confidence drops below required thresholds</p></li><li><p><strong>Audit &amp; Compliance Service</strong>: Logs all identity correlation decisions and confidence score changes</p></li></ul><p><strong>Machine Learning Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Model Training

resolution to proceed with cached data when real-time services are impacted</p></li><li><p>Fallback to simpler algorithms when advanced ML services are unavailable, with confidence scoring adjusted accordingly</p></li></ul><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-SemanticTranslationDependencies">Semantic Translation Dependencies</h2><p>Semantic Translation Service operates with complex dependencies on ontology management systems and reasoning engines while providing critical translation capabilities that other services require for cross-context evidence sharing.</p><p><strong>Upstream Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ontology Management System</strong>: Version-controlled storage of OWL ontologies and semantic mappings</p></li><li><p><strong>Reasoning Engine Infrastructure</strong>: HermiT reasoner and OWL API for logical inference operations</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity Resolution Service</strong>: Identity cluster information for context-aware translation</p></li></ul><p><strong>Downstream Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Award Calculation Service</strong>: Consumes translated evidence for policy-specific entitlement calculations</p></li><li><p><strong>External Integration Gateway</strong>: Provides translated evidence for partner organization consumption</p></li><li><p><strong>Investigation Queue Service</strong>: Identifies semantic conflicts that require human review</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ontology Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>DCS Core Ontology</strong>: Base vocabularies and semantic relationships for all internal translations</p></li><li><p><strong>Product-Specific Ontologies</strong>: BasicSupport, FamilyAssist, AgeCare vocabularies with regular

patterns to reduce real-time reasoning overhead</p></li></ul><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-AwardCalculationDependencies">Award Calculation Dependencies</h2><p>Award Calculation Service represents the most complex dependency scenario, requiring high-quality input from multiple upstream services while maintaining strict accuracy and audit requirements for financial decisions affecting citizens.</p><p><strong>Critical Upstream Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Identity Resolution Service</strong>: High-confidence identity clusters required before award calculations can proceed</p></li><li><p><strong>Semantic Translation Service</strong>: Translated evidence appropriate for specific benefit policy contexts</p></li><li><p><strong>Policy Rule Engine</strong>: Drools rule sets with current rates, thresholds, and eligibility criteria</p></li></ul><p><strong>Supporting Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Investigation Queue Service</strong>: Case creation when confidence thresholds are not met for automated processing</p></li><li><p><strong>Notification Service</strong>: Citizen communication about award decisions, changes, and required evidence</p></li><li><p><strong>External Integration Gateway</strong>: Status updates to partner systems about award outcomes</p></li></ul><p><strong>Data Quality Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Confidence Threshold Configuration</strong>: Real-time access to current confidence requirements for different benefit types and award amounts</p></li><li><p><strong>Historical Data Services</strong>: Access to previous award calculations for retrospective change processing</p></li><li><p><strong>Rate Table Services</strong>: Current benefit rates, income thresholds, and deduction parameters</p></li></ul><p><strong>Fault Tolerance Mechanisms:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Graceful Degradation</strong>: Reduced automation with increased human review when confidence services are impacted</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction Rollback</strong>: Database transaction management ensures award calculations can be reversed if downstream processes fail</p></li><li><p><strong>Decision Queue</strong>: Asynchronous processing enables award calculations to complete even when notification services are temporarily unavailable</p></li></ul><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-InvestigationQueueDependencies">Investigation Queue Dependencies</h2><p>Investigation Queue Service operates with dependencies on all other platform services while implementing sophisticated workflow management that continues operating even when individual dependencies experience problems.</p><p><strong>Workflow Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="http://Temporal.io" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://Temporal.io</a> <strong> Infrastructure</strong>: Workflow orchestration platform for complex investigation processes with state management</p></li><li><p><strong>Case Assignment Engine</strong>: Integration with HR systems for caseworker skill profiles, workload tracking, and availability</p></li><li><p><strong>Priority Scoring System</strong>: Real-time access to fraud detection algorithms and financial impact assessment</p></li></ul><p><strong>Integration Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>All Core Services</strong>: Investigation queue receives triggers from evidence ingestion, identity resolution, semantic translation, and award calculation</p></li><li><p><strong>External Systems</strong>: Integration with partner organizations for evidence verification and fraud investigation coordination</p></li><li><p><strong>Notification Service</strong>: Communication with citizens and caseworkers about investigation status and requirements</p></li></ul><p><strong>Monitoring

Management</strong>: Automated escalation based on case age, complexity, and business impact</p></li><li><p><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: Integration with audit systems for investigation outcome tracking and performance analysis</p></li></ul><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-Cross-CuttingServiceDependencies">Cross-Cutting Service Dependencies</h2><p>Several services provide capabilities that all other services depend on, creating shared dependency relationships that require careful management to prevent single points of failure.</p><p><strong>Audit &amp; Compliance Service Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>All Platform Services</strong>: Every service generates audit events requiring comprehensive logging</p></li><li><p><strong>Elasticsearch Cluster</strong>: Scalable storage and search capabilities for audit trail management</p></li><li><p><strong>Compliance Reporting</strong>: Integration with regulatory reporting systems and data protection management</p></li></ul><p><strong>Notification Service Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>All Business Services</strong>: Investigation queue, award calculation, and identity resolution trigger various notification types</p></li><li><p><strong>External Communication Providers</strong>: Government notification services, email providers, postal services for multi-channel delivery</p></li><li><p><strong>Citizen Preference Management</strong>: Integration with citizen portal systems for communication preference handling</p></li></ul><p><strong>External Integration

Identity Management</strong>: Integration with external authentication systems and certificate management</p></li><li><p><strong>All Internal Services</strong>: Gateway provides external access to evidence submission, status checking, and webhook capabilities</p></li></ul><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-DependencyManagementStrategies">Dependency Management Strategies</h2><p><strong>Circuit Breaker Patterns:</strong> Each service implements circuit breakers that prevent cascading failures when dependencies are slow or unavailable. When a dependency fails, services fall back to cached data or reduced functionality rather than failing completely.</p><p><strong>Bulkhead Isolation:</strong> Critical processing workflows are isolated from each other so that problems in one area don't affect unrelated operations. Evidence ingestion continues even when award calculation experiences problems.</p><p><strong>Timeout and Retry Logic:</strong> All inter-service calls implement appropriate timeouts with exponential backoff retry strategies that prevent services from waiting indefinitely for dependencies while allowing recovery from transient failures.</p><p><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> Services reduce functionality rather than failing completely when dependencies are unavailable. Identity resolution may use simpler algorithms when ML services are impacted, with confidence scores adjusted to reflect reduced capability.</p><p><strong>Health Check Monitoring:</strong> Comprehensive health checks monitor both service availability and dependency health, enabling proactive intervention before problems affect citizen services.</p><p><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Services use dependency injection patterns that enable testing with mock dependencies and support configuration changes without code modifications.</p><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-Event-DrivenResilience">Event-Driven Resilience</h2><p><strong>Asynchronous Processing:</strong> Most service interactions occur through event streams rather than synchronous calls, enabling services to process at their own pace while maintaining overall system responsiveness.</p><p><strong>Event Sourcing:</strong> Critical business events are stored in immutable event logs that enable system recovery and audit capabilities while supporting replay of processing workflows when services recover from failures.</p><p><strong>Saga Patterns:</strong> Complex workflows that span multiple services use saga patterns to coordinate transactions while supporting compensation and rollback when individual steps fail.</p><p><strong>Dead Letter Queues:</strong> Failed events are routed to dead letter queues for analysis and reprocessing, ensuring that temporary failures don't result in permanent data loss.</p><h2 id="ServiceDependencies-PerformanceandScalingDependencies">Performance and Scaling Dependencies</h2><p><strong>Shared Infrastructure Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Triple Store Cluster</strong>: All services depend on the primary RDF database for evidence storage and retrieval</p></li><li><p><strong>Redis Cache Cluster</strong>: Shared caching infrastructure that improves performance across all services</p></li><li><p><strong>Kafka Event Infrastructure</strong>: Event streaming backbone that enables loose coupling while maintaining reliable processing</p></li></ul><p><strong>Independent Scaling:</strong> Services scale independently based on their specific performance characteristics and load patterns, with evidence ingestion scaling for document processing volume while identity resolution scales for clustering computation requirements.</p><p><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Each service operates behind load balancers that distribute traffic and provide health checking, enabling services to scale horizontally without affecting dependent services.</p><p><strong>Database Connection Pooling:</strong> Shared database connections are managed through connection pools that prevent individual services from exhausting database capacity while providing fair access to shared resources.</p><p />
