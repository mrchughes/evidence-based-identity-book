                    <p>The Solution Architecture provides the comprehensive technical blueprint for our evidence-based identity platform, integrating business needs with technical capabilities to deliver transformative citizen services. This architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining a cohesive citizen experience while preserving the policy autonomy that different benefit areas require. It does this through an innovative layered approach that separates evidence accumulation from policy interpretation, enabling raw verified facts to be collected once while being interpreted appropriately by each product area.</p><p /><p>At the technical heart of this solution is a sophisticated semantic reasoning engine built on RDF triple stores that represents all information as simple &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; statements with full context about who said it, when, and how they verified it. This approach enables both powerful inference capabilities and complete provenance tracking for every piece of information in the system. The architecture implements confidence-based decision authority where explicit thresholds determine when automated processing can proceed versus when human intervention is required, focusing precious human attention where it adds the most value.</p><p /><p>The solution is designed around six core capabilities that work together to transform government operations. First, unified evidence accumulation that captures information once across all products. Second, intelligent identity resolution that builds understanding of real-world identity through probabilistic matching. Third, semantic translation that enables different policies to interpret the same evidence according to their specific needs. Fourth, exception-based case management that identifies and prioritizes cases requiring human judgment. Fifth, cross-system pattern recognition that detects fraud and improves service delivery. And sixth, automated retrospective processing that efficiently handles changes in circumstances across all affected products.</p><p /><ul class='childpages-macro'><li><a href="Architecture-Principles_363120.html" data-linked-resource-id="363120" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Architecture Principles</a></li><li><a href="Component-Overview_102959.html" data-linked-resource-id="102959" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Component Overview</a></li><li><a href="High-Level-Design_102942.html" data-linked-resource-id="102942" data-linked-resource-version="5" data-linked-resource-type="page">High-Level Design</a></li><li><a href="Integration-Patterns_363137.html" data-linked-resource-id="363137" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Integration Patterns</a></li></ul>
