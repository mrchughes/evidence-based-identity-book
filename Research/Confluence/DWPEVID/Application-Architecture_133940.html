                    <p /><p>The Application Architecture defines the sophisticated microservices ecosystem that powers our evidence-based identity platform. At its heart lies a carefully orchestrated set of eight core services that work together to transform raw evidence into confident decisions while maintaining complete audit trails and seamless user experiences. This architecture balances flexibility with reliability through clean separation of concerns, enabling each service to evolve independently while preserving system integrity through well-defined interfaces and comprehensive event-driven communication.</p><p /><p>Our microservices implement domain-driven design principles where each service owns specific business capabilities and data domains. The Evidence Ingestion Service transforms diverse inputs into standardized assertions with full provenance. Identity Resolution Service applies probabilistic algorithms to build understanding of real-world identity through accumulated evidence. Semantic Translation Service enables cross-product evidence sharing while preserving policy autonomy. Award Calculation Service makes confidence-based financial decisions that protect both citizens and DCS. Investigation Queue Service focuses human attention where it adds the most value. These capabilities are supported by comprehensive Notification, Audit, and External Integration services that ensure transparent, compliant operations.</p><p /><p>The technical implementation employs modern, proven technologies including Node.js, Python, Java, and Go - each selected for its specific strengths in addressing particular domain challenges. This polyglot approach enables the right tool for each job while containerization through Kubernetes provides consistent deployment, scaling, and operational management. The event-driven communication backbone using Apache Kafka ensures reliable processing and system resilience, enabling services to evolve independently while maintaining overall system coherence.</p><p /><ul class='childpages-macro'><li><a href="API-Specifications_69202.html" data-linked-resource-id="69202" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">API Specifications</a></li><li><a href="Microservices-Catalog_134008.html" data-linked-resource-id="134008" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Microservices Catalog</a></li><li><a href="Service-Dependencies_69219.html" data-linked-resource-id="69219" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Service Dependencies</a></li><li><a href="Technology-Choices_363154.html" data-linked-resource-id="363154" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Technology Choices</a></li></ul>
