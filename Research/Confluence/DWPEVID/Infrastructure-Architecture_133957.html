                    <p>The Infrastructure Architecture establishes a secure, scalable, and resilient foundation for the evidence-based identity platform. Taking a cloud-native approach, it leverages hybrid multi-cloud deployment across AWS and Azure government clouds to ensure both operational resilience and compliance with data sovereignty requirements. This architecture employs infrastructure-as-code principles throughout, using Terraform and GitOps workflows to ensure consistent, auditable, and reproducible environments across development, testing, and production stages. Zero-trust security principles are implemented at every layer, with comprehensive encryption, fine-grained access controls, and continuous security monitoring.</p><p /><p>Our deployment model uses Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform, providing consistent operational capabilities across environments while enabling workload portability between clouds when needed. This approach facilitates both high availability and disaster recovery capabilities through multi-region deployment and automated failover procedures. The platform implements auto-scaling at multiple levels - from individual microservices to database clusters - ensuring efficient resource utilization while maintaining performance during peak loads like benefit application periods or retrospective processing events.</p><p /><p>The operational model emphasizes observability through comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing capabilities. Every aspect of the system generates structured telemetry data that flows into centralized monitoring systems, enabling both automated alerting and sophisticated analytics for performance optimization. This approach supports both proactive issue detection through anomaly identification and efficient reactive troubleshooting when incidents occur. The result is an infrastructure foundation that enables the business transformation while maintaining the security, reliability, and performance that citizens expect from critical government services.</p><p /><ul class='childpages-macro'><li><a href="Deployment-Model_103027.html" data-linked-resource-id="103027" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Deployment Model</a></li><li><a href="Disaster-Recovery_134042.html" data-linked-resource-id="134042" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Disaster Recovery</a></li><li><a href="69253.html" data-linked-resource-id="69253" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Performance &amp; Scaling</a></li><li><a href="Security-Design_134025.html" data-linked-resource-id="134025" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Security Design</a></li></ul>
