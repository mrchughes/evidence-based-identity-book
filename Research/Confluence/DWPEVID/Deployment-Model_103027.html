Each environment serves specific purposes with appropriate data protection, performance characteristics, and access controls that match their operational requirements.</p><p>The deployment model implements infrastructure as code principles using Kubernetes orchestration, enabling consistent deployment patterns across environments while supporting environment-specific configurations for performance, security, and compliance requirements. This approach ensures that infrastructure changes are version-controlled, auditable, and repeatable across all deployment targets.</p><p><strong>Environment Hierarchy:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Development</strong>: Rapid iteration with synthetic data for feature development and unit testing</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Service integration testing with sanitized production-like data volumes</p></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Production</strong>: Performance testing and security validation with full production configuration</p></li><li><p><strong>Production</strong>: Live citizen services with high availability, disaster recovery, and compliance monitoring</p></li></ul><p>Each environment maintains appropriate isolation through network segmentation, identity management, and data classification policies that prevent unauthorized access while enabling necessary integration testing and performance validation.</p><h2 id="DeploymentModel-KubernetesClusterArchitecture">Kubernetes Cluster Architecture</h2><p>The platform deploys on Kubernetes clusters configured for government cloud environments with security hardening, compliance monitoring, and operational resilience appropriate for citizen-facing services. Cluster architecture supports both horizontal scaling for high-volume processing and vertical scaling for compute-intensive operations like semantic reasoning.</p><p><strong>Cluster Configuration:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Control Plane</strong>: High availability with etcd clustering across multiple availability zones</p></li><li><p><strong>Worker Nodes</strong>: Mixed instance types optimized for different workload characteristics</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Policy</strong>: Microsegmentation with Calico for pod-to-pod communication control</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage Classes</strong>: Multiple storage tiers for different performance and durability requirements</p></li></ul><p>Namespace organization provides logical separation between different platform components while enabling controlled inter-service communication through network policies and service mesh configuration.
