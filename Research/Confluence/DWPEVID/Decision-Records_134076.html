                    <h2 id="DecisionRecords-ArchitecturalDecisionRecordsFramework">Architectural Decision Records Framework</h2><p>The evidence-based identity platform would maintain comprehensive architectural decision records (ADRs) that document significant technical and design choices made throughout platform development. These records would provide context for future development teams while establishing clear rationale for architectural approaches that may seem unconventional compared to traditional government systems.</p><p>Decision records would follow a structured format that captures the problem context, alternative solutions considered, decision rationale, and anticipated consequences. This approach would ensure that architectural choices remain understandable and defensible as the platform evolves and team membership changes over time.</p><p>The ADR framework would distinguish between different types of decisions including core architectural patterns, technology selection, security design choices, and operational procedures. Each category would receive appropriate documentation depth based on the decision's impact scope and reversibility.</p><p><strong>ADR Categories:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Strategic Architecture</strong>: Fundamental design patterns affecting the entire platform</p></li><li><p><strong>Technology Selection</strong>: Specific technology choices with long-term implications</p></li><li><p><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: Decisions affecting data protection and regulatory compliance</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration Patterns</strong>: Approaches for external system integration and partner connectivity</p></li><li><p><strong>Operational Design</strong>: Decisions affecting deployment, monitoring, and maintenance procedures</p></li></ul><h2 id="DecisionRecords-StrategicArchitectureDecisions">Strategic Architecture Decisions</h2><h3 id="DecisionRecords-ADR-001:RDFTripleStoreasPrimaryDataModel">ADR-001: RDF Triple Store as Primary Data Model</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Proposed <strong>Date</strong>: 2025-03-15 <strong>Context</strong>: The platform would require flexible data representation that can accommodate diverse evidence types while maintaining semantic relationships and enabling sophisticated reasoning capabilities.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Traditional relational database models cannot efficiently represent the uncertain, interconnected, and evolving nature of citizen evidence. The platform would need to correlate evidence across different systems, maintain provenance metadata, and support semantic reasoning for cross-product evidence translation.</p><p><strong>Alternatives Considered:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Document Database (MongoDB)</strong>: Flexible schema but poor support for semantic relationships and reasoning</p></li><li><p><strong>Graph Database (Neo4j)</strong>: Good relationship modeling but limited semantic reasoning capabilities</p></li><li><p><strong>Hybrid Relational/NoSQL</strong>: Complex architecture with difficult consistency management</p></li><li><p><strong>RDF Triple Store</strong>: Native semantic support with reasoning capabilities but potential performance concerns</p></li></ul><p><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement Apache Jena Fuseki with TDB2 as the primary data store for all evidence, identity clusters, and semantic relationships.</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>: RDF triple stores would provide native support for semantic web standards, enabling sophisticated reasoning while maintaining complete provenance for all assertions. The W3C standards would ensure interoperability with external systems while supporting the complex identity resolution and evidence correlation requirements central to the platform's value proposition.</p><p><strong>Consequences</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Would enable sophisticated semantic reasoning and cross-product evidence translation</p></li><li><p>Would require specialized expertise in semantic web technologies and SPARQL query optimization</p></li><li><p>May require performance optimization through hybrid architecture with operational databases</p></li><li><p>Would provide future-proof foundation for AI/ML integration and cross-government evidence sharing</p></li></ul><h3 id="DecisionRecords-ADR-002:MicroservicesArchitecturewithEvent-DrivenCommunication">ADR-002: Microservices Architecture with Event-Driven Communication</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Proposed <strong>Date</strong>: 2025-03-20 <strong>Context</strong>: The platform would need to support independent scaling of different functional capabilities while maintaining loose coupling and enabling incremental deployment across DCS product areas.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Monolithic architecture would create deployment dependencies and prevent independent scaling of evidence processing, identity resolution, and award calculation services. The platform would need to support different development teams working on different components without blocking each other.</p><p><strong>Alternatives Considered:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong>: Simpler deployment but tight coupling and scaling limitations</p></li><li><p><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong>: Better modularity but potential performance overhead from synchronous communication</p></li><li><p><strong>Microservices with Synchronous APIs</strong>: Good modularity but brittle failure patterns</p></li><li><p><strong>Event-Driven Microservices</strong>: Loose coupling with complexity in distributed state management</p></li></ul><p><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement microservices architecture with Apache Kafka for event-driven communication between services.</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Event-driven microservices would enable independent service development and deployment while providing resilience through asynchronous communication. This architecture would support the platform's requirements for handling high-volume evidence processing while maintaining responsiveness for citizen-facing operations.</p><p><strong>Consequences</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Would enable independent scaling and deployment of different platform capabilities</p></li><li><p>Would require sophisticated distributed system design and monitoring</p></li><li><p>Would provide resilience through loose coupling and event replay capabilities</p></li><li><p>Would increase operational complexity compared to monolithic alternatives</p></li></ul><h3 id="DecisionRecords-ADR-003:Confidence-BasedProcessingwithHumanOversight">ADR-003: Confidence-Based Processing with Human Oversight</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Proposed <strong>Date</strong>: 2025-04-02 <strong>Context</strong>: Government benefit decisions would require high accuracy while enabling automation for efficiency gains. The platform would need to manage uncertainty explicitly rather than hiding it behind false certainty.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Traditional government systems make binary decisions based on incomplete information, leading to errors and citizen dissatisfaction. The platform would need to automate routine decisions while routing uncertain cases to human review without appearing unreliable to citizens.</p><p><strong>Alternatives Considered:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Binary Automated Decisions</strong>: Simple implementation but high error rates for edge cases</p></li><li><p><strong>Manual Review for All Cases</strong>: High accuracy but no efficiency gains</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk-Based Processing</strong>: Some automation but limited by predefined risk categories</p></li><li><p><strong>Confidence-Based Thresholds</strong>: Graduated automation with explicit uncertainty management</p></li></ul><p><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement confidence scoring for all evidence and decisions with configurable thresholds that determine when automated processing can proceed versus when human review is required.</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Confidence-based processing would enable sophisticated automation while maintaining appropriate human oversight for uncertain cases. This approach would provide transparency about decision quality while enabling continuous improvement through threshold adjustment based on operational experience.</p><p><strong>Consequences</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Would enable high-accuracy automation for clear cases while routing complex cases to human review</p></li><li><p>Would require sophisticated confidence calculation algorithms and threshold management</p></li><li><p>Would provide transparency and auditability for all automated decisions</p></li><li><p>Would support continuous improvement through confidence accuracy measurement and adjustment</p></li></ul><h2 id="DecisionRecords-TechnologySelectionDecisions">Technology Selection Decisions</h2><h3 id="DecisionRecords-ADR-004:KubernetesforContainerOrchestration">ADR-004: Kubernetes for Container Orchestration</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Proposed <strong>Date</strong>: 2025-04-10 <strong>Context</strong>: The platform would require scalable deployment across multiple environments with security controls appropriate for government systems handling citizen data.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Traditional virtual machine deployment patterns cannot provide the agility and resource efficiency needed for microservices architecture while meeting government security and compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>Alternatives Considered</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Virtual Machine Deployment</strong>: Simple but inefficient resource utilization and slow scaling</p></li><li><p><strong>Docker Swarm</strong>: Easier than Kubernetes but limited ecosystem and scaling capabilities</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS ECS/Fargate</strong>: Managed service but vendor lock-in and limited control</p></li><li><p><strong>Kubernetes</strong>: Industry standard with government-appropriate security controls</p></li></ul><p><strong>Decision</strong>: Deploy on Kubernetes with government cloud infrastructure and security hardening.</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Kubernetes would provide the most mature and flexible container orchestration platform with extensive security controls and monitoring capabilities.
