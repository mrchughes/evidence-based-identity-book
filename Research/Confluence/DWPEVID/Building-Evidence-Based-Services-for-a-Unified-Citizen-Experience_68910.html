This platform proposal represents a fundamental shift from record-based systems to evidence-based reasoning, enabling citizens and caseworkers to work with familiar binary outcomes while the system becomes intelligent about uncertainty and risk.</p><p>At its core, this transformation would address a critical challenge: DCS's current federation shares policy-interpreted attributes rather than raw evidence, creating fragmentation and preventing legitimate policy divergence. Citizens repeatedly provide identical evidence across different DCS services, while caseworkers manually process retrospective changes and investigate conflicts that could be automatically detected and prioritized.</p><p>The proposed evidence-based identity platform would treat all information as simple statements of &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; with full context about who said it, when, and how they verified it. Raw evidence would accumulate once across all DCS services, different policies could interpret the same evidence appropriately for their specific needs, and benefit awards would only happen when the system has high confidence about both who someone is and their circumstances.</p><h3 id="BuildingEvidence-BasedServicesforaUnifiedCitizenExperience-ArchitectureNavigation"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="9bd90a8b-34ed-4085-83aa-ca6340976d13">Architecture Navigation</span></h3><p>This comprehensive architecture documentation covers every aspect of the proposed platform design, from strategic vision through detailed implementation guidance.
