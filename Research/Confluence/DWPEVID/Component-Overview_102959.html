<h2 id="ComponentOverview-EvidenceIngestionService">Evidence Ingestion Service</h2><p>The Evidence Ingestion Service serves as the primary entry point for all evidence entering the platform, whether from document uploads, structured API submissions, or bulk data feeds from external partners. This service transforms diverse input formats into consistent RDF assertions while maintaining complete provenance and applying appropriate confidence scoring based on verification methods and source credibility.</p><p>The document processing pipeline handles uploaded files through OCR extraction using Apache Tika and Tesseract, cryptographic signature verification for digitally signed documents, and intelligent assertion extraction that identifies relevant claims within unstructured text. For example, a payslip upload generates assertions about employer identity, employment period, gross pay, tax deductions, and payment frequency, each with confidence scores reflecting document quality and verification features.</p><p>Structured evidence submission through REST APIs processes assertions from trusted external systems like HMRC's Real Time Information feeds, applying source-specific confidence weighting based on the submitting organization's verification standards. The service validates assertion format against SHACL shapes while preserving flexibility for new evidence types that emerge as the platform evolves.</p><p>The bulk processing capabilities handle high-volume feeds from partners like local authorities and government departments, implementing sophisticated error handling and progress tracking that ensures reliable processing of thousands of evidence items while maintaining system performance. Quality assessment algorithms analyze batch patterns to identify systematic data issues that require partner attention.</p><p>All evidence processing generates comprehensive audit trails that link final assertions back to original sources, processing algorithms, and confidence calculation methods. This enables complete accountability for evidence interpretation while supporting appeals processes and continuous improvement of extraction algorithms.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-IdentityResolutionService">Identity Resolution Service</h2><p>The Identity Resolution Service implements sophisticated probabilistic algorithms that determine when different evidence items likely refer to the same real-world person, managing the fundamental uncertainty inherent in identity correlation while providing confidence scores that enable risk-based decision making.</p><p>The attribute matching engine uses fuzzy string matching for names, geographic distance calculations for addresses, and temporal analysis for dates of birth to identify potential correlations between different subject identifiers. Machine learning models trained on verified identity correlations enhance matching accuracy while accounting for common variations in how the same person appears across different systems.</p><p>Graph analysis capabilities detect relationship patterns that support identity correlation, identifying when multiple subjects share family connections, employment history, or residence patterns that suggest they represent the same individual. Network analysis algorithms can identify complex identity fraud scenarios where multiple fake identities share suspicious correlation patterns.</p><p>DID correlation handles the complex scenario where citizens use multiple Digital Identities for different services, analyzing attribute overlap and interaction patterns to suggest correlations while preserving citizen privacy choices about service separation. The service respects citizen preferences for maintaining separate digital identities while enabling appropriate evidence sharing when citizens authorize correlation.</p><p>Confidence calculation algorithms account for evidence quality, temporal factors, and correlation strength to provide nuanced identity confidence scores that reflect the actual reliability of identity determinations. These scores enable graduated responses to uncertainty rather than binary accept/reject decisions that don't reflect the complexity of real-world identity management.</p><p>Cluster management operations handle identity merging when new evidence strongly suggests previously separate identities represent the same person, as well as cluster splitting when investigation reveals that a single cluster incorrectly merged different individuals. These operations maintain complete audit trails and trigger appropriate recalculation of any awards that depended on the affected identity clusters.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-SemanticTranslationService">Semantic Translation Service</h2><p>The Semantic Translation Service enables evidence sharing between different systems and policy contexts while preserving meaning, confidence levels, and audit trails. This service implements the sophisticated ontology mappings that allow evidence verified for one purpose to be appropriately interpreted for different policy requirements without losing semantic precision.</p><p>The OWL ontology framework defines formal relationships between different vocabulary systems used across DCS products and external partners. For example, the service understands that HMRC's &quot;annual salary via Real Time Information&quot; maps to BasicSupport's &quot;verified monthly employment income&quot; through a division-by-twelve conversion, while preserving the confidence level and verification metadata from the original assertion.</p><p>Reasoning engines apply logical inference rules to derive new assertions from existing evidence combinations. When employment evidence exists for one person and family relationship evidence links them to another person, the reasoning engine can derive potential household income implications for family-based benefit calculations while maintaining appropriate confidence scores for the derived information.</p><p>Validation capabilities ensure that semantic translations preserve logical consistency and don't introduce contradictions into the evidence graph. SHACL shape validation prevents translations that would violate business rules or create impossible combinations of assertions about the same subject.</p><p>The service handles bidirectional translation requirements, enabling evidence to flow from any system to any other system while maintaining semantic accuracy. Local authority housing evidence can be appropriately interpreted for DCS housing benefit calculations, while DCS income verification can support local authority social care assessments through appropriate semantic mappings.</p><p>Version control and change management ensure that ontology updates don't disrupt ongoing operations while enabling continuous improvement of semantic mappings based on operational experience. All translation decisions are auditable, enabling analysis of translation accuracy and identification of areas where ontology refinement would improve system performance.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-AwardCalculationService">Award Calculation Service</h2><p>The Award Calculation Service implements the policy engines and business rules that determine benefit entitlements based on available evidence and confidence levels. This service integrates sophisticated rule engines with confidence-based processing to ensure that awards occur only when evidence quality meets appropriate thresholds for the financial impact and duration of the benefit.</p><p>The Drools rule engine implements complex eligibility criteria and calculation logic for different benefit types, with rules organized into modular components that can be updated independently as policy requirements evolve. Rules reference evidence assertions through semantic queries that automatically account for confidence levels and temporal validity.</p><p>Confidence threshold management ensures that awards proceed only when both identity confidence and attribute confidence meet requirements appropriate for the specific benefit type and amount. Emergency payments may proceed with lower confidence thresholds than long-term awards, while high-value benefits require stronger evidence verification than basic support payments.</p><p>Historical recalculation capabilities handle retrospective changes of circumstances by automatically identifying affected time periods and applying appropriate business rules about prospective versus retrospective application of evidence changes. When new employment evidence emerges that affects historical periods, the service calculates overpayments or underpayments while generating investigation tasks for cases requiring human review.</p><p>Simulation and &quot;what-if&quot; analysis enables policy testing and citizen guidance by calculating potential award amounts based on hypothetical evidence scenarios without creating actual awards or storing personal data. This supports both policy development and citizen understanding of how different circumstances would affect their entitlements.</p><p>The audit trail capabilities provide comprehensive records of how award decisions were made, including all evidence considered, confidence scores applied, policy rules triggered, and any human interventions or overrides. This supports accountability requirements, appeals processes, and continuous improvement of calculation algorithms.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-InvestigationQueueService">Investigation Queue Service</h2><p>The Investigation Queue Service manages exception workflows when confidence levels are insufficient for automated processing or when evidence conflicts require human intervention. This service implements sophisticated case prioritization, skill-based routing, and outcome tracking that ensure human attention focuses where it can add most value.</p><p>Risk scoring algorithms analyze evidence patterns to identify cases requiring urgent attention, potential fraud indicators, or complex circumstances that need specialist expertise. High-value discrepancies, identity confidence conflicts, and suspicious correlation patterns receive priority routing to appropriate investigation teams.</p><p>Case assignment capabilities match investigations to caseworkers based on their skills, workload, and expertise with specific types of cases. Identity fraud investigations route to specialists trained in verification techniques, while complex disability assessments route to caseworkers with health condition expertise and appropriate security clearances.</p><p>Workflow management tracks investigation progress through defined stages, ensuring that cases advance according to established procedures while maintaining flexibility for complex scenarios that require non-standard approaches. Automated reminders and escalation procedures prevent cases from stalling while preserving caseworker autonomy in investigation methods.</p><p>Integration with external systems enables investigators to request additional verification from partner organizations, schedule citizen appointments, and coordinate with other government departments when investigations reveal cross-departmental issues. The service maintains comprehensive audit trails of all investigation activities and outcomes.</p><p>Performance metrics and reporting provide management visibility into investigation queue performance, resolution times, outcome distributions, and caseworker productivity to support resource planning and process improvement. Historical analysis identifies patterns that can inform automation improvements and training needs.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-NotificationService">Notification Service</h2><p>The Notification Service manages all communication with citizens and caseworkers through multiple channels while ensuring messages are appropriate, accessible, and actionable. This service handles the complex logic required to determine when notifications should be sent, through which channels, and with what content based on recipient preferences and message urgency.</p><p>Template management ensures consistent, clear communication that meets accessibility requirements and plain English standards while supporting personalization based on citizen circumstances and communication preferences. Templates include variables for dynamic content and support multiple languages with automatic fallback when preferred languages aren't available.</p><p>Multi-channel delivery supports email, SMS, postal mail, in-app notifications, and secure messaging through citizen portals, with intelligent routing based on recipient preferences and message type. Critical notifications like award suspensions use multiple channels to ensure delivery, while routine updates respect citizen preferences for their preferred communication methods.</p><p>Delivery tracking and confirmation provide comprehensive audit trails showing when messages were sent, which delivery methods were attempted, and whether delivery was successful. Failed delivery triggers automatic retry through alternative channels while maintaining audit records of all delivery attempts.</p><p>Citizen preference management enables granular control over notification types and delivery methods, supporting privacy requirements while ensuring that critical information reaches citizens even when they've opted out of non-essential communications. Citizens can specify preferences like &quot;urgent messages via SMS, routine updates via email, and legal notices via secure post.&quot;</p><p>The service integrates with the investigation queue and award calculation services to automatically generate appropriate notifications when case status changes, evidence is required, or awards are modified. Automated content generation ensures that messages include relevant context while maintaining professional tone and accuracy.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-AuditandComplianceService">Audit and Compliance Service</h2><p>The Audit and Compliance Service maintains comprehensive audit trails for all platform operations while providing the reporting and analysis capabilities required for regulatory compliance, accountability, and continuous improvement. This service operates across all other platform components to ensure complete visibility into evidence processing, decision making, and system operations.</p><p>Comprehensive logging captures all evidence updates, confidence changes, identity correlations, award calculations, and user interactions with detailed context about business purposes, technical operations, and outcomes. Audit records include user attribution, timestamp information, and sufficient detail to reconstruct decision processes for accountability and appeals.</p><p>Search and analysis capabilities enable complex queries across audit trails using filters for date ranges, user types, action types, and affected entities. This supports compliance investigations, performance analysis, and identification of patterns that might indicate system issues or training needs for operational staff.</p><p>Compliance reporting generates formatted reports that meet specific regulatory requirements such as Data Protection Impact Assessments, equality monitoring, and fraud prevention audits. Reports can be scheduled automatically and include statistical analysis of decision patterns and system performance metrics.</p><p>Data retention management handles the complex requirements for maintaining audit information according to different regulatory frameworks while supporting operational needs for historical analysis. The service ensures that audit data is preserved for appropriate periods while implementing secure deletion when retention periods expire.</p><p>Privacy protection within audit trails ensures that comprehensive logging doesn't compromise citizen privacy through techniques like differential privacy for statistical analysis and secure anonymization when audit data is used for system improvement purposes.</p><h2 id="ComponentOverview-ExternalIntegrationGateway">External Integration Gateway</h2><p>The External Integration Gateway provides secure, standardized interfaces for partner organizations to submit evidence and query processing status while protecting internal platform operations from external system variations and security threats. This gateway implements the authentication, authorization, and rate limiting required for reliable high-volume integration.</p><p>Partner authentication supports multiple methods including OAuth 2.0 client credentials for trusted systems and mTLS certificates for high-security partners like HMRC and other government departments. Authentication integrates with partner identity management systems while maintaining strong security controls and comprehensive audit trails.</p><p>Evidence submission APIs are designed around evidence-over-attributes principles, capturing full verification context rather than just derived data points. Partners provide not just &quot;John Smith earns £30,000&quot; but &quot;ABC Corporation reports via statutory filing that employee John Smith (NINO: AB123456C) earned £30,000 during tax year 2024-25, verified through digital submission on 15th March 2025.&quot;</p><p>Rate limiting and quality controls protect platform stability while ensuring fair access for all partners during high-volume processing periods. The gateway implements sophisticated throttling that accounts for partner priority levels, submission quality, and system capacity to optimize overall throughput.</p><p>API versioning and backward compatibility ensure that partner integrations remain stable as the platform evolves while providing migration paths for new capabilities. Partners can adopt new features according to their development schedules without being forced to upgrade immediately when platform capabilities expand.</p><p>Comprehensive documentation and SDK generation enable partners to integrate effectively with minimal technical complexity while understanding the semantic requirements for high-quality evidence submission. Clear examples and validation tools help partners optimize their integration quality and processing efficiency.</p><p />
