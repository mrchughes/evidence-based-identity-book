This ensures appropriate balance between security and accessibility across different benefit types and award values.</p><p><strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong></p><p>Standardized interfaces that enable different software systems to communicate with each other. In the evidence-based identity platform, APIs facilitate secure data exchange between microservices and with external partners.</p><p><strong>Assertion</strong></p><p>A structured statement about a fact, attribute, or relationship that has been claimed by a specific source. Assertions follow the pattern &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; with metadata about verification methods and temporal context.</p><p><strong>Attribute</strong></p><p>A specific characteristic or piece of information about a person or entity, such as name, address, income, or household composition. In the evidence-based identity platform, attributes are derived from evidence rather than stored as primary data.</p><p><strong>Audit Trail</strong></p><p>A chronological record of system activities that provides documentary evidence of the sequence of activities affecting operations, procedures, or events. In the evidence-based platform, audit trails capture all evidence processing, identity resolution, and award decisions.</p><p><strong>B</strong></p><p><strong>BasicSupport</strong></p><p>A sample benefit program referenced in the architecture documentation that focuses on employment-related eligibility calculations and requires recent employment verification.</p><p><strong>C</strong></p><p><strong>Case Management</strong></p><p>The process of handling exceptions, investigations, and manual reviews where human judgment is required. The evidence-based platform implements exception-based case management that prioritizes cases requiring human attention based on confidence levels and risk factors.</p><p><strong>Citizen</strong></p><p>An individual who interacts with DCS services, providing evidence and receiving benefits. In the evidence-based platform, citizens experience simple interfaces while sophisticated probabilistic reasoning operates behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Confidence Level</strong></p><p>A quantified assessment of certainty regarding identity verification, evidence quality, or attribute accuracy. The platform uses confidence levels to determine when automated processing can proceed versus when human intervention is required.</p><p><strong>Confidence-Based Decision Authority</strong></p><p>A framework that establishes explicit thresholds determining when automated processing can proceed versus when human intervention is required, based on the level of confidence in identity and evidence.</p><p><strong>Confidence Threshold</strong></p><p>The minimum level of certainty required to make an automated decision, with higher thresholds for higher-value transactions. Different benefit types and award amounts have different confidence requirements based on risk profiles.</p><p><strong>Cross-System Pattern Recognition</strong></p><p>The capability to analyze evidence and behaviors across multiple systems to detect patterns that might indicate fraud, opportunities for improved service delivery, or citizen needs that span multiple service areas.</p><p><strong>D</strong></p><p><strong>Data Architecture</strong></p><p>The structural design of data storage, processing, and access that enables the evidence-based platform. In this platform, it revolves around RDF triple stores, ontologies, and semantic reasoning capabilities.</p><p><strong>Data Minimization</strong></p><p>A privacy principle that limits data collection and processing to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose.

The platform extracts structured assertions from documents with full provenance metadata.</p><p><strong>E</strong></p><p><strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong></p><p>A software architecture pattern promoting production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. The evidence-based platform uses Apache Kafka for reliable event-driven communication between microservices.</p><p><strong>Evidence</strong></p><p>Information that supports or contradicts claims about identity or circumstances. In the evidence-based platform, evidence is the primary asset, with all derived attributes calculated from the evidence base.</p><p><strong>Evidence Accumulation</strong></p><p>The core business capability of gathering and storing evidence from multiple sources with full context preservation. Evidence accumulates once across all DCS services rather than being duplicated in separate systems.</p><p><strong>Evidence Ingestion Service</strong></p><p>A microservice that transforms diverse inputs (documents, API responses, form submissions) into standardized assertions with full provenance metadata.</p><p><strong>Evidence Portfolio</strong></p><p>The complete set of evidence associated with a specific identity cluster, representing the accumulated knowledge about a real-world person based on all available information.</p><p><strong>Exception-Based Case Management</strong></p><p>An operational approach where routine cases are processed automatically while only cases requiring human judgment are routed to caseworkers. This focuses human attention where it adds the most value.</p><p><strong>F</strong></p><p><strong>Fraud Detection</strong></p><p>The process of identifying potentially fraudulent activity through pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and cross-checking of evidence. The evidence-based approach provides natural fraud prevention by requiring diverse, temporally consistent evidence.</p><p><strong>G</strong></p><p><strong>GitOps</strong></p><p>A set of practices that uses Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. The evidence-based platform uses GitOps workflows to ensure consistent, auditable, and reproducible environments.</p><p><strong>I</strong></p><p><strong>Identity Cluster</strong></p><p>A probabilistic grouping of evidence that likely refers to the same real-world person. Clusters can evolve as new evidence arrives or analysis improves.</p><p><strong>Identity Resolution Service</strong></p><p>A microservice that applies probabilistic algorithms to build understanding of real-world identity through accumulated evidence, creating and maintaining identity clusters.</p><p><strong>Identity Resolution</strong></p><p>The process of determining when different pieces of evidence likely refer to the same real-world person. In the evidence-based platform, this is a probabilistic process rather than a deterministic one.</p><p><strong>Inference Engine</strong></p><p>A component that derives logical conclusions from available evidence using rules, patterns, and probabilistic reasoning. The evidence-based platform operates as a continuous inference engine that builds understanding through reasoning over accumulated evidence.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure-as-Code</strong></p><p>The practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes. The evidence-based platform uses Terraform for infrastructure-as-code implementation.</p><p><strong>Intelligent Identity Resolution</strong></p><p>A core business capability that builds understanding of real-world identity through probabilistic matching across multiple evidence sources, creating and maintaining identity clusters with appropriate confidence levels.</p><p><strong>K</strong></p><p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p><p>An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The evidence-based platform uses Kubernetes for consistent operational capabilities across environments.</p><p><strong>M</strong></p><p><strong>Microservice</strong></p><p>A software architecture style where complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. The evidence-based platform is built on a set of specialized microservices.</p><p><strong>O</strong></p><p><strong>Ontology</strong></p><p>A formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.

The evidence-based platform uses probabilistic matching for identity resolution across diverse evidence sources.</p><p><strong>Provenance</strong></p><p>Information about the origin, source, custody, and ownership of information. In the evidence-based platform, all evidence maintains comprehensive provenance metadata capturing who provided it, when, and how they verified it.</p><p><strong>R</strong></p><p><strong>RDF (Resource Description Framework)</strong></p><p>A standard model for data interchange on the Web that extends the linking structure of the Web by using URIs to name the relationship between things. The evidence-based platform uses RDF triple stores as the foundation of its data architecture.</p><p><strong>Retrospective Processing</strong></p><p>The handling of changes in circumstances that affect past periods, requiring recalculation of entitlements and potential adjustments to awards. The platform implements automated retrospective processing that efficiently handles changes across all affected products.</p><p><strong>S</strong></p><p><strong>Semantic Reasoning</strong></p><p>The process of drawing logical conclusions from semantic data models. The evidence-based platform uses semantic reasoning to derive conclusions from evidence and identify patterns across multiple data sources.</p><p><strong>Semantic Translation</strong></p><p>The process of converting evidence between different policy contexts while preserving meaning and provenance. This capability enables cross-product evidence sharing while preserving policy autonomy.</p><p><strong>Semantic Translation Service</strong></p><p>A microservice that enables different policies to interpret the same evidence according to their specific needs through automated conversion between different semantic contexts.</p><p><strong>Service Mesh</strong></p><p>A dedicated infrastructure layer that enables service-to-service communication between microservices, handling monitoring, access control, and other communication concerns. The evidence-based platform uses Istio as its service mesh implementation.</p><p><strong>T</strong></p><p><strong>Temporal Dimension</strong></p><p>The aspect of data that captures changes over time, including effective dates, verification dates, and submission timestamps. The evidence-based platform incorporates temporal dimensions for all evidence, enabling point-in-time historical views.</p><p><strong>Triple Store</strong></p><p>A specialized database for storing and retrieving RDF triples through semantic queries. The evidence-based platform uses a triple store as the core data repository for all evidence and identity information.</p><p><strong>Triple</strong></p><p>A data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, like &quot;John has-income 2500&quot;, representing a statement about a resource. In RDF, all three elements of a triple are identified by URIs, enabling sophisticated semantic reasoning.</p><p><strong>V</strong></p><p><strong>Verification</strong></p><p>The process of confirming the accuracy or truth of information. The evidence-based platform tracks verification methods and rigor for all evidence, using this information in confidence scoring.</p><p><strong>Z</strong></p><p><strong>Zero-Trust Security</strong></p><p>A security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside their perimeters and must verify everything trying to connect to their systems. The evidence-based platform implements zero-trust security principles at every layer.</p>
