                    <p>The Data Architecture represents a paradigm shift from traditional product-centric data models to an evidence-centric approach that forms the foundation of our transformation. At its core is a sophisticated triple-store RDF database that maintains a comprehensive graph of all citizen evidence, identity associations, and benefit entitlements. This semantic data model allows us to represent complex real-world relationships that traditional relational databases struggle to capture effectively. By modeling data as statements about real-world entities rather than records in tables, we gain unprecedented flexibility to incorporate new evidence types without disruptive schema changes.</p><p /><p>Our evidence-centric data model introduces several critical innovations. First, it separates physical evidence (documents, data submissions, API responses) from the logical assertions derived from them, enabling us to track provenance and maintain confidence levels for each piece of information. Second, it explicitly represents identity resolution as probabilistic clusters rather than definitive matches, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in identity resolution. Third, it incorporates temporal dimensions for all evidence, enabling point-in-time historical views and supporting retrospective processing capabilities.</p><p /><p>Perhaps most importantly, the data architecture implements robust privacy controls and consent management directly in the data layer. Rather than treating privacy as an application-level concern, access controls and data minimization principles are embedded in the core data model. This approach ensures that evidence sharing occurs only when legally permitted and properly authorized, while still enabling the cross-product coordination benefits that citizens expect. The result is a data foundation that balances privacy protection with service delivery improvement, building trust while enhancing operational capabilities</p><p /><ul class='childpages-macro'><li><a href="Data-Governance_102993.html" data-linked-resource-id="102993" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Data Governance</a></li><li><a href="Data-Model_363171.html" data-linked-resource-id="363171" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Data Model</a></li><li><a href="Ontology-Framework_102976.html" data-linked-resource-id="102976" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ontology Framework</a></li><li><a href="Triple-Store-Design_363188.html" data-linked-resource-id="363188" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">Triple Store Design</a></li></ul>
