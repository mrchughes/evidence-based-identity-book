                    <h2 id="OperatingModel-FundamentalOrganizationalTransformation">Fundamental Organizational Transformation</h2><p>The proposed evidence-based identity platform would require fundamental changes to how DCS organizes work, makes decisions, and measures success. The transformation would move from product-centric silos toward evidence-centric operations where different benefit areas collaborate around shared citizen evidence while maintaining their distinct policy responsibilities. This operating model would preserve departmental autonomy while enabling the evidence sharing and coordination that citizens expect from government.</p><p>The platform's managed complexity approach would mean that organizational changes occur primarily in backend operations while front-line staff continue working with familiar interfaces and decision frameworks. Citizens would still interact with recognizable BasicSupport, FamilyAssist, and AgeCare services, but these services would now share evidence and coordinate responses behind the scenes through the semantic translation and identity resolution capabilities.</p><p>Central to the new operating model would be the principle that evidence belongs to citizens rather than to specific DCS products. Evidence ingestion would create assertions that describe what external sources have said about citizen circumstances, with full provenance and confidence metadata. Different DCS products could then interpret this evidence according to their specific policy requirements through the semantic translation service, eliminating duplicate evidence gathering while preserving legitimate policy differences.</p><p>The investigation queue service would fundamentally change how exceptions and complex cases are handled. Rather than each product area managing its own investigation workflows, the platform would create unified case management that routes investigations to appropriately skilled staff regardless of which product originally triggered the review. This would enable better resource utilization while ensuring citizens receive consistent support across their entire relationship with DCS.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-Evidence-CentricWorkflowDesign">Evidence-Centric Workflow Design</h2><p>Daily operations would shift from document processing toward evidence verification and confidence assessment. Caseworkers would spend less time manually entering data from forms and documents, and more time interpreting evidence quality, resolving conflicts between sources, and making decisions about cases where confidence levels don't meet automated processing thresholds.</p><p>The evidence ingestion service would handle routine document processing automatically, extracting assertions from uploaded documents and correlating them with existing evidence clusters through the identity resolution service. This automation would eliminate much of the manual data entry that currently consumes caseworker time while ensuring consistent evidence quality assessment across all DCS services.</p><p>When new evidence arrives that affects existing awards, the platform would automatically trigger recalculation through the award calculation service rather than requiring manual intervention. Caseworkers would receive notifications only when recalculations identify significant discrepancies that require investigation or when confidence levels drop below thresholds that require additional verification.</p><p>The semantic translation service would enable caseworkers to focus on policy application rather than evidence interpretation. When supporting citizens who receive multiple benefits, caseworkers could see how the same evidence applies to different policy contexts without needing to understand the technical details of evidence correlation or semantic reasoning.</p><p>Investigation workflows would become more sophisticated through risk-based prioritization and intelligent case routing. The investigation queue service would analyze evidence patterns to identify cases requiring urgent attention, potential fraud indicators, or complex circumstances that need specialist skills. This would ensure that human attention focuses where it can add most value while routine cases process automatically.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-Confidence-BasedDecisionAuthority">Confidence-Based Decision Authority</h2><p>The proposed operating model would introduce explicit confidence thresholds that determine when automated processing can proceed versus when human intervention is required. Different benefit types and award amounts would have different confidence requirements, with higher-value or longer-term awards requiring stronger evidence verification than emergency payments or temporary support.</p><p>Caseworkers would receive enhanced authority to make decisions about evidence interpretation and confidence assessment, but within clear frameworks that ensure consistency across the organization. The platform would provide tools that show evidence quality, highlight potential conflicts, and suggest additional verification steps, but preserve human judgment about whether evidence is sufficient for specific decisions.</p><p>Senior caseworkers and team leaders would gain new responsibilities for monitoring confidence threshold performance and adjusting parameters based on operational experience. If fraud levels increase in certain case types, confidence thresholds could be raised to require additional verification. If processing delays affect citizen service, thresholds could be lowered where risk assessment supports faster processing.</p><p>The audit and compliance service would provide comprehensive monitoring of automated decision quality, enabling continuous improvement of confidence scoring algorithms and evidence assessment procedures. When appeals or investigations reveal that confidence assessments were incorrect, these lessons would feed back into improved scoring models and caseworker training.</p><p>Quality assurance would shift from post-decision review toward preventive confidence assessment. Rather than checking completed awards for errors, quality teams would monitor evidence confidence patterns to identify systematic issues before they affect citizen payments. This proactive approach would reduce errors while improving citizen experience through faster, more reliable processing.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-Cross-ProductCollaborationFramework">Cross-Product Collaboration Framework</h2><p>The platform would enable new forms of collaboration between different DCS product areas while preserving their distinct policy responsibilities and operational autonomy. Product teams could share evidence and insights without compromising their ability to serve their specific citizen populations according to appropriate policy frameworks.</p><p>BasicSupport teams would benefit from employment evidence gathered through other products' verification processes, while FamilyAssist teams could leverage housing verification conducted for housing benefit assessments. This evidence sharing would reduce verification burden across the organization while ensuring that policy-specific requirements are still met through the semantic translation capabilities.</p><p>Cross-product fraud detection would become significantly more sophisticated through evidence correlation across the entire DCS federation. Patterns that might appear legitimate within a single product context would become visible when viewed across multiple benefit interactions. The investigation queue service would coordinate fraud investigations across product boundaries, ensuring that complex fraud schemes are identified and addressed comprehensively.</p><p>Joint investigation teams could be formed dynamically based on case requirements rather than fixed organizational boundaries. When evidence patterns suggest complex fraud involving multiple benefits, the platform could automatically assemble investigation teams with appropriate skills from across different product areas while maintaining clear accountability and case management.</p><p>Knowledge sharing between product areas would improve through shared evidence patterns and outcome analysis. Teams could see which verification approaches prove most effective for different citizen circumstances, enabling best practice sharing that improves performance across the organization without forcing standardization that conflicts with legitimate policy differences.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-PerformanceManagementandMetrics">Performance Management and Metrics</h2><p>Success metrics would shift from transaction-focused measures toward outcome-based assessment that reflects the platform's citizen-centric approach. Processing time measurements would account for evidence reuse, with returning citizens benefiting from previously verified information while new citizens receive appropriate verification attention.</p><p>Fraud detection metrics would become more sophisticated through cross-product correlation, measuring not just fraud prevented within individual products but patterns identified through evidence sharing across the DCS federation. The platform's comprehensive audit trails would enable detailed analysis of fraud prevention effectiveness while supporting continuous improvement of detection algorithms.</p><p>Citizen experience metrics would expand beyond satisfaction surveys to include objective measures like evidence re-submission rates, processing time reductions, and successful evidence reuse across products. The platform's event-driven architecture would enable real-time monitoring of citizen journey patterns, identifying friction points and improvement opportunities.</p><p>Caseworker performance assessment would adapt to recognize the enhanced roles that evidence-based operations create. Metrics would account for complex case resolution, evidence quality assessment, and citizen advocacy activities rather than just transaction volume. Caseworkers who excel at interpreting evidence conflicts or supporting citizens through complex circumstances would receive recognition for these value-adding activities.</p><p>Organizational learning would accelerate through evidence-based analysis of operational patterns. The platform's comprehensive data capture would enable detailed analysis of which operational approaches prove most effective for different scenarios, supporting data-driven improvement of policies, procedures, and training programs.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-ResourceAllocationandCapacityPlanning">Resource Allocation and Capacity Planning</h2><p>The platform would enable more intelligent resource allocation through predictive analysis of investigation queue patterns and evidence processing demands. Historical evidence patterns could predict when seasonal changes, policy updates, or external events will create capacity demands, enabling proactive staffing adjustments.</p><p>Caseworker specialization would become more flexible through the investigation queue's intelligent routing capabilities. Staff could develop expertise in specific types of complex cases (identity verification, fraud investigation, disability assessment) while still handling routine work when specialized demand is low. This flexibility would improve resource utilization while maintaining service quality.</p><p>Automation of routine evidence processing would shift capacity toward higher-value activities like citizen support, complex case resolution, and continuous improvement initiatives. The platform's confidence-based processing would mean that human attention focuses on cases where it can add genuine value rather than routine verification tasks that machines can handle more efficiently.</p><p>Cross-product resource sharing would become possible through the unified investigation queue and evidence management systems. During peak periods for specific benefits, staff from other areas could support evidence processing and case resolution without needing extensive product-specific training, as the platform would provide the context and tools needed for effective case management.</p><p>Investment in technology capabilities would reduce long-term operational costs through automation and improved efficiency, while requiring strategic investment in semantic web technologies, identity resolution systems, and staff training during the transition period. The business case demonstrates positive return on investment through reduced processing costs, improved fraud prevention, and better citizen outcomes.</p><h2 id="OperatingModel-ChangeManagementandTransitionStrategy">Change Management and Transition Strategy</h2><p>The operating model transition would follow a phased approach that preserves operational continuity while gradually introducing new capabilities and working methods. Early phases would focus on evidence ingestion and basic confidence scoring, allowing staff to become familiar with new tools before more sophisticated capabilities like cross-product investigation coordination are introduced.</p><p>Training programs would emphasize the enhanced caseworker roles that evidence-based operations enable, positioning technology as augmenting rather than replacing human expertise. Staff would learn to interpret confidence scores, understand evidence quality indicators, and use semantic translation tools while maintaining their core skills in citizen support and policy application.</p><p>Legacy system integration would ensure that existing workflows continue operating during the transition period. The external integration gateway would provide adapters that allow current systems to interact with the evidence-based platform gradually, without requiring immediate replacement of all existing tools and processes.</p><p>Success metrics and feedback mechanisms would enable continuous adjustment of the operating model based on operational experience. Regular review cycles would assess whether confidence thresholds, investigation routing, and automation levels are achieving intended outcomes while maintaining service quality and staff satisfaction.</p><p>Cultural change initiatives would emphasize the citizen-centric benefits of evidence-based operations, helping staff understand how new working methods improve outcomes for the people they serve. Success stories and concrete examples would demonstrate how evidence reuse reduces citizen burden while enabling better decision-making through comprehensive information access.</p><p />
