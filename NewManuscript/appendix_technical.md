# Appendix A: Technical Specifications

This appendix provides comprehensive technical specifications for implementing evidence-based identity platforms, including detailed API schemas, data models, security frameworks, deployment configurations, multi-channel evidence integration, and semantic translation patterns. These specifications enable technical teams to build production-ready systems that serve citizens through multiple pathways while maintaining democratic accountability and citizen rights protection.

## Architecture Overview

The evidence-based identity platform operates through eight core microservices that handle evidence ingestion, identity resolution, semantic translation, decision calculation, fraud investigation, citizen notification, audit compliance, and external integration. The architecture supports multiple citizen interaction methods including digital identity wallets for advanced users, UI redirect orchestration for guided evidence gathering, API integration for seamless evidence collection, and traditional document processing, all maintaining cryptographic verifiability and semantic integrity.

```

The architecture emphasizes horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and democratic accountability through comprehensive audit trails, citizen control mechanisms, and explainable decision-making processes. The Multi-Channel Integration Service enables citizens to interact through their preferred method: wallet-mediated evidence sharing for those comfortable with digital credentials, guided evidence gathering through familiar authentication for those preferring assisted approaches, or traditional document submission, all while maintaining semantic translation capabilities that handle ontological differences between organizations.

## Evidence Data Model Specification

The evidence data model provides structured representation of all information about citizen circumstances while maintaining provenance, confidence assessment, and privacy protection. The model supports complex reasoning while preserving citizen rights and democratic accountability, with extensions for multi-channel evidence collection including wallet-mediated sharing, API integration, and guided evidence gathering.
